This repository contains JavaScript based examples of many
popular algorithms and data structures.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own separate README
with related explanations and links for source.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

    * [Segment Tree](data-structures/tree/segment-tree)

## Algorithms

An algorithm is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. It is
a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.
