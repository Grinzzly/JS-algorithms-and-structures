In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, 
a **graph** is a structure amounting to a set of objects in 
which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". The 
objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices 
(also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices 
is called an edge (also called an arc or line).

A **graph** may be **undirected**, meaning that there is no distinction between 
the two vertices associated with each edge, or its edges may be **directed** 
from one vertex to another;

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly 
mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together 
with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an 
undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a 
directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, 
or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, 
directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines 
for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of 
the graph structure, or may be external entities 
represented by integer indices or references.

In computer science, a **graph** is an abstract data type 
that is meant to implement the concept from mathematics.

There is two ways of graph implementation:
 * Through **Adjacency List**
 
   In graph theory and computer science, an **adjacency list** is a collection of unordered lists 
   used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the graph. 
   This is one of several commonly used representations of graphs for use in computer programs.
     
 * Through Adjacency Matrix
    
   In graph theory and computer science, an **adjacency matrix** is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph. 
   The elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent or not in the graph.
