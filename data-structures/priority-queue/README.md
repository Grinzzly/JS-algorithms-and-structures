# Priority Queue

In computer science, a **priority queue** is an abstract data type which is like a 
regular queue or stack data structure, but where additionally each element has 
a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high 
priority is served before an element with low priority. In some implementations, 
if two elements have the same priority, they are served according to the order in 
which they were enqueued, while in other implementations, ordering of elements with 
the same priority is undefined.

While priority queues are often implemented with heaps, they are conceptually distinct 
from heaps. A priority queue is an abstract concept like "a list" or "a map"; just as a 
list can be implemented with a linked list or an array, a priority queue can be implemented 
with a heap or a variety of other methods such as an unordered array.
